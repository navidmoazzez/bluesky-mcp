# Bluesky MCP Server & CLI changelog

| Component | Version | Last Updated |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| bluesky-mcp-cli | 1.2.1 | 2026-09-04 |

---

## 1.2.1

Every link in the package pointed at a GitHub account that no longer exists.

The account was renamed, so the clone command, the issues link, the security
advisory link, the release download and the setup URL inside `src/` were all
resolving through GitHub's rename redirect. That redirect stops working the
moment someone else claims the old name.

npm serves whatever was in the published tarball, so fixing GitHub did not fix
the package page. This release is what actually corrects it.

## 1.2.0

Analytics, and the flags an agent needs.

### Analytics

Bluesky publishes no analytics API, so every dashboard builds its own. It turns
out not to need one: `likeCount`, `repostCount`, `replyCount` and `quoteCount`
already ride along on every post the feed returns, and this server was rendering
them and throwing them away.

`rank_posts` sorts your posts by engagement. `get_post_stats` does one post.
`get_engagement_summary` gives totals, averages, an engagement rate against
followers, and a breakdown by format so you can see whether images earn their
effort. `get_posting_patterns` crosses your posting times with the engagement
they got, by hour and by weekday.

All four run on any public account with no credentials, the same way the
reading tools do. 45 tools now, 30 of them reads.

Deliberately absent: follower growth, which is a trend and cannot come from a
snapshot; impressions, which Bluesky exposes to nobody; and bookmarks, which are
not confirmed publicly readable.

### Agent mode

`--agent` is `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes` in one flag.
`--select uri,author.handle` keeps only the fields named: dotted paths descend
and arrays traverse element-wise.

### Exit codes

0 success, 2 usage, 3 not found, 4 auth, 5 API, 7 rate limited, 10 config, so a
script branches on a number instead of parsing a message. It returned 0 or 1
before.

### Fixed

`schema <command>` printed the Zod object's internals rather than the JSON
Schema an MCP client actually receives.

CI asserted a hardcoded tool count, so adding a tool turned the build red with
nothing wrong. It compares against `ALL_TOOLS` now.

---

## 1.1.0

A CLI, and a rename to match.

### Every tool is now a shell command

All 41 tools run from the terminal. The command is the tool name: `create_post`
runs as `create-post`, and the underscore spelling works too. Flags, help text
and validation come from the same schema the MCP tool declares, so both surfaces
accept the same arguments and a tool added tomorrow is a command tomorrow.

`--confirm`, `BLUESKY_READ_ONLY`, `BLUESKY_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE` and the audit log
behave identically whichever surface you use.

### Two binaries

`bluesky-mcp` is the server your AI app runs. `bluesky-cli` is the one you type,
and run bare it lists every command. Help output names the binary you actually
typed.

### Renamed to bluesky-mcp-cli

So the name says both surfaces. The npm scope is unchanged and the server binary
is still `bluesky-mcp`, so existing client configs keep working.

### Known gap

Read commands return the tagged text, so `--json` gives that text as a JSON
string rather than fields to filter on. Writes and the account commands return
real objects you can pipe into `jq`.

21 new tests, 82 total.

---

## 1.0.0

First release. 41 tools, 61 tests.

### Posting

Links, hashtags and mentions are marked up before publishing, with each mention
resolved to an account ID. Bluesky renders nothing on its own: post the raw
string and every link and mention is inert grey text, with no error to notice.

A reply names the thread's root, not just its parent. Naming only the parent
produces a post Bluesky accepts and then never lists in the thread it belongs to.

Images carry alt text and a measured aspect ratio, so a tall screenshot is not
letterboxed. Video goes through Bluesky's transcoding service and is polled to
completion. Uploading it as a plain file publishes cleanly and then plays for
nobody.

`create_thread` validates every part before posting any of them, so a thread
never half-publishes because part four was too long.

### The character limit

300 *graphemes* and 3,000 *bytes*, checked separately, which is what Bluesky
actually enforces. Counting JavaScript string length instead rejects legal
posts: one family emoji is one character to Bluesky and eleven to JavaScript.

### Output

Feeds, threads and search results come back as tagged text rather than raw API
JSON. Measured on a 50-post feed: 49,839 characters against 521,426, roughly
12,500 tokens instead of 130,000. Timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC so two can be
compared, a repost wraps the original rather than flattening it, deleted and
blocked posts get placeholders, and moderation labels are surfaced.

### Tools

41. Every action has its inverse: `unlike_post`, `unrepost`, `unfollow`,
`unmute_account`, `unblock_account`. Plus `create_thread`, `delete_post`,
`set_reply_permissions`, `get_quotes`, `get_relationships`, `get_lists`,
`get_notifications`, `mark_notifications_seen`, `get_suggested_follows`,
`list_accounts`, `whoami`.

### Safety

`create_post`, `create_thread`, `delete_post` and `block_account` need
`confirm: true`. `BLUESKY_READ_ONLY=1` removes every write from the tool list,
leaving 26 read tools. `BLUESKY_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=0` keeps likes and follows but
blocks posting and deleting. `BLUESKY_AUDIT_LOG` records every attempted write,
mode 0600. Every tool carries MCP annotations.

### Multi-account

`BLUESKY_ACCOUNTS` takes a JSON array, and every tool that acts as someone takes
an optional `account`. `BLUESKY_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT` decides which acts when none is
named, with exact handle matches beating prefix matches so two similar handles
cannot be confused.

### Reliability

Sessions are cached per account and refreshed rather than re-created, because
creating one is rate limited hard and a session lasts about two hours. Rate
limits and server errors are retried with backoff that honours the reset header.
Requests have a timeout and a minimum interval between them, so a paginating
command stays polite. Reads that need no login go to the public API, so the
server is useful before it is configured.
