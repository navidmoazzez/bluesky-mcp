/**
 * Rich text on the way out: turning plain text into facets.
 *
 * Bluesky renders nothing on its own. A URL in a post is grey text unless a
 * facet marks its byte range; an @mention is grey text unless a facet carries
 * the mentioned account's **DID**, not its handle. This is the single largest
 * gap in both reference servers: berlinbra's cannot post at all, and
 * brianellin's posts the raw string with no facets, so every link and every
 * mention it publishes is dead text.
 *
 * The detection regexes are the ones from @atproto/api's `detectFacets`, kept
 * deliberately identical so a post written here segments the same way the
 * official client would segment it. What is *not* copied is the `tlds` package:
 * a mention is validated by resolving it, which is a check the TLD list only
 * approximates, and a bare domain is checked against a bundled common-TLD list
 * so "see navid.me" links while "e.g. this" does not.
 *
 * Offsets are UTF-8 byte positions. An emoji before a link shifts every offset
 * after it, which is why nothing here indexes the JS string directly.
